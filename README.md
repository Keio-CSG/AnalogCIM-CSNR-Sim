# AnalogCIM-CSNR-Sim

This repository contains Python scripts for simulating and analyzing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in Analog Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures. The simulation focuses on quantization effects and noise in CIM operations, providing insights into the performance of these systems under various conditions.

# Features

* Simulation of ACIM calculation process with quantization and noise
* Analysis of SQNR and CSNR under various conditions
* Visualization of results for different ADC bit resolutions and noise levels
* Replication of results from published research papers

# Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
